# Maze Path Finder

## Overview
This project is probably the first working code of mine, so enjoy inspecting the first steps of a new-born programmer:)

The code itself implements 5 different algorithms for finding a path in a maze between a starting point and an ending one. 

## Implemented Algorithms
- Random search
- Depth-first search
- Breadth-first search
- Greedy search
- A* algorithm.
